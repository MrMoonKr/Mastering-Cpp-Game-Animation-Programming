# Chapter 12

In this chapter you will learn how to add collision detection with level data
* Implement a specialized octree for the level geometry
* Learn how to query both octrees to find the triangles instances are colliding with
* Add a basic gravity to keep the instances on the floor
* Understand and implement inverse kinematics to let the instance's legs follow slopes
